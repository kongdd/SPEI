\value{
Functions \code{spei} and \code{spi} return an object of class \code{spei}. The generic 
functions \code{print} and \code{summary} can be used to obtain summaries of the results. 
The generic accessor functions \code{coefficients} and \code{fitted} extract useful features 
of the object.

An object of class \code{spei} is a list containing at least the following components:

\itemize{
  \item call: the call to \code{spei} or \code{spi} used to generate the object.
  \item fitted: time series with the values of the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration 
  Index (SPEI) or the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). If data consists of several columns 
  the function will treat each column as independent data, and the result will be a multivariate 
  time series. The names of the columns in \code{data} will be used as column names in fitted.
  \item coefficients: an array with the values of the coefficients of the distribution function 
  fitted to the data. The first dimension of the array contains the three (or two) coefficients, 
  the second dimension will typically consist of twelve values corresponding to each month, and 
  the third dimension will be equal to the number of columns (series) in \code{data}. If a time 
  scale greater than one has been used then the first elements will have NA value since the kernel 
  can not be applied. The first element with valid data will be the one corresponding to the time 
  scale chosen.
  \item scale: the \code{scale} parameter used to generate the object.
  \item kernel: the parameters and values of the kernel used to generate the object.
  \item distribution: the distribution function used to generate the object.
  \item fit: the fitting method used to generate the object.
  \item na.action: the value of the na.action parameter used.
  \item data: if requested, the input data used.

\description{
Given a time series of the climatic water balance (precipitation minus 
potential evapotranspiration), gives a time series of the Standardized 
Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI).
}
\details{
The \code{spei} and \code{spi} functions allow computing the SPEI 
and the SPI indices. These are climatic proxies widely used for drought 
quantification and monitoring. Both functions are identical (in fact, 
\code{spi} is just a wrapper for \code{spei}), but they are kept 
separated for clarity. Basically, the functions standardize a variable 
following a log-Logistic (or Gamma, or PearsonIII) distribution function 
(i.e., they transform it to a standard Gaussian variate with zero mean 
and standard deviation of one).
}
\section{Input data}{

The input variable is a time ordered series of precipitation values 
for \code{spi}, or a series of the climatic water balance (precipitation 
minus potential evapotranspiration) for \code{spei}. When used with the 
default options, it would yield values of both indices exactly as defined 
in the references given below.

The SPEI and the SPI were defined for monthly data. Since the PDFs of the
data are not homogenous from month to month, the data is split into twelve
series (one for each month) and independent PDFs are fit to each series. If 
\code{data} is a vector or a matrix it will be treated as a sequence of monthly 
values starting in January. If it is a (univariate or multivariate) time series
then the function \code{\link{cycle}} will be used to determine the position of 
each observation within the year (month), allowing the data to start in a month 
other than January.
}

\section{Time scales}{

An important advantage of the SPEI and the SPI is that they can be computed at 
different time scales. This way it is possible to incorporate the influence of 
the past values of the variable in the computation enabling the index to adapt 
to the memory of the system under study. The magnitude of this memory is 
controlled by parameter \code{scale}. For example, a value of six would imply 
that data from the current month and of the past five months will be used for 
computing the SPEI or SPI value for a given month. By default all past data will 
have the same weight in computing the index, as it was originally proposed in the 
references below. Other kernels, however, are available through parameter \code{kernel}. 
The parameter \code{kernel} is a list defining the shape of the kernel and a time shift. 
These parameters are then passed to the function \code{\link{kern}}.
}

\section{Probability distributions}{

Following the original definitions \code{spei} uses a log-Logistic distribution 
by default, and \code{spi} uses a Gamma distribution. This behaviour can be modified, 
however, through parameter \code{distribution}.
}

\section{Fitting methods}{

The default method for parameter fitting is based on unbiased Probability Weighted 
Moments ('ub-pwm'), but other methods can be used through parameter \code{fit}. 
A valid alternative is the plotting-position PWM ('pp-pwm') method. For the log-Logistic 
distribution, also the maximum likelihood method ('max-lik') is available.
}

\section{User-provided parameters}{

An option exists to override parameter fitting and provide user default parameters. 
This is activated with the parameter \code{params}. The exact values provided to this 
parameter depend on the distribution function being used. For log-Logistic and PearsonIII 
it should be a three-dimensional array with dimensions (3,number of series in data,12), 
containing twelve parameter triads (xi, alpha, kappa) for each data series, one for each
month. For Gamma, a three-dimensional array with dimensions (2,number of series in data,12), 
containing twelve parameter pairs (alpha, beta). It is a good idea to look at the 
coefficients slot of a previously fit \code{spei} spei object in order to understand the 
structure of the parameter array. The parameter \code{distribution} is still used under 
this option in order to know what distribution function should be used.
}

\section{Reference period}{

The default behaviour of the functions is using all the values provided in \code{data} 
for parameter fitting. However, this can be modified with help of parameters \code{ref.start} 
and \code{ref.end}. These parameters allow defining a subset of values that will be used 
for parameter fitting, i.e. a reference period. The functions, however, will compute the 
values of the indices for the whole data set. For these options to work it is necessary that 
\code{data} will be a time series object. The starting and ending points of the reference period 
will then be defined as pairs of year and month values, e.g. c(1900,1).
}

\section{Processing large datasets}{

It is possible to use the \code{spei} and \code{spi} functions for processing multivariate 
datasets at once. If a matrix or data frame is supplied as \code{data}, with time series of 
precipitation or precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration arranged in columns, the 
result would be a matrix (data frame) of spi or spei series. This makes processing large datasets 
extremely easy, since no loops need to be used.
