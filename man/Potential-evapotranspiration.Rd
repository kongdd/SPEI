\description{
Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is the amount of evaporation and 
transpiration that would occur if a sufficient water source were available. Reference 
evapotranspiration (ET0) is the amount of evaporation and transpiration from a reference 
vegetation of grass. They are usually considered equivalent. This set of functions 
calculate PET or ET0 accordind to the Thornthwaite, Hargreaves or Penman-Monteith 
equations.

\details{
\code{thornthwaite} computes the monthly potential evapotranspiration (PE) according to the
Thornthwaite (1948) equation. It is the simplest of the three methods, and can be used when only 
temperature data are available.


\code{hargreaves} computes the monthly reference evapotranspiration (ET0) of a grass crop based 
on the original Hargreaves equation (1994). However, if precipitation data \code{Pre} is provided 
a modified form due to Droogers and Allen (2002) will be used; this equation corrects ET0 using 
the amount of rain of each month as a proxy for insolation. The Hargreaves method requires data 
on the mean external radiation, \code{Ra}. If such data are not available it can be estimated 
from the latitude \code{lat} and the month of the year.

\code{penman} calculates the monthly reference evapotranspiration (ET0) of a hypothetical 
reference crop according to the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation described in Allen et al. (1994). 
This is a simplification of the original Penman-Monteith equation, and has found widespread use. 
By default the original parameterization of Allen et al. (1994) is used, corresponding to a short 
reference crop of 0.12 m height. Parameterization for a tall reference crop of 0.5 m height due 
to Walter et al. (2002) can also be used, by setting the \code{crop} parameter to 'tall'. The 
method requires data on the incoming solar radiation, \code{Rs}; since this is seldom available, 
the code will estimate it from data on the bright sunshine duration \code{tsun}, or alternatively 
from data on the percent cloud cover \code{CC}. Similarly, if data on the saturation water 
pressure \code{ed} are not available, it is possible to estimate it from the dewpoint temperature
 \code{Tdew}, from the relative humidity \code{RH} or even from the minimum temperature \code{Tmin} 
 (sorted from least to most uncertain method). Similarly, the atmospheric surface pressure \code{P} 
 required for computing the psychrometric constant can be calculated from the atmospheric pressure at 
 sea level \code{P0} and the elevation \code{z}, or else it will be assumed to be constant (101.3 kPa). 
 The code will produce an error message if a valid combination of input parameters is not provided.

If the main input object (\code{Tave}, \code{Tmin}, \code{Tmax}) is a vector or a matrix, data will
be treated as a sequence of monthly values starting in January. If it is a time series then the 
function \code{\link{cycle}} will be used to determine the position of each observation within the 
year (month), allowing the data to start in a month different than January.
